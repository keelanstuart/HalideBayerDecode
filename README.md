First, to build this, you will need Halide present... you can obtain it from their github release page:
https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases

You'll also need libpng from https://libpng.sourceforge.io (and other mirrors)

You'll need to change this project's settings to indicate the direct you have placed Halide and libpng
(currently "d:\proj\halide" and "d:\proj\png", respectively, in "Settings" -> "VC++ Directories")

This makes use to Halide to convert a bayer mosaicked image to RGB
Algorithm loosely based on the paper by McGuire
(https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/088a/2f47b7ab99c78d41623bdfaf4acdb02358fb.pdf)

I make some assumptions here...
a) the input is in RG/GB form (as opposed to GR/GB, GB/RG, or BG/GR)
b) the input image has all three channels, not a single channel

Halide makes some things drastically more complicated because it goes forward from
the input -- as opposed to working backwards from the output as you might in 3D
rendering, where the resultant pixel fragment is what causes the relevant source texels to be sampled
and processed in whatever way is desired.
